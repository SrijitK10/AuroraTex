## Project Configuration

Each project contains a `project.json` file with settings:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-project-id",
  "name": "Project Name",
  "mainFile": "main.tex",
  "settings": {
    "engine": "pdflatex",
    "shellEscape": false,
    "bibTool": "bibtex",
    "timeoutMs": 180000
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### LaTeX Not Found
If the application cannot find your LaTeX installation:
1. Check that `pdflatex` is in your system PATH
2. Restart the application after installing LaTeX
3. Check the application logs for detection attempts

### Compilation Errors
- Check the log panel for detailed error messages
- Ensure all required packages are installed
- Verify file paths and references are correct
- Try compiling with a simpler document to test setup

### Performance Issues
- Large projects may take longer to compile
- Consider splitting large documents into smaller files
- Clear auxiliary files periodically

## Building for Distribution

To create distributable packages:

```bash
npm run package
```

This creates platform-specific installers in the `dist-electron/` directory.

## Technology Stack

- **Electron**: Desktop application framework
- **React**: UI library with TypeScript
- **CodeMirror 6**: Advanced code editor
- **PDF.js**: PDF rendering and display
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Better SQLite3**: Fast, reliable database (when enabled)
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime and file operations

## Architecture Principles

1. **Security First**: All file operations are validated and sandboxed
2. **Offline First**: No external dependencies during runtime
3. **Performance**: Efficient compilation pipeline with job queuing
4. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and recovery
5. **Extensibility**: Modular architecture for future enhancements
