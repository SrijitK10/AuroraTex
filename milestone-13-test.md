# Milestone 13 - Performance & UX Polish - Testing Guide

This document outlines how to test all the newly implemented Milestone 13 features to ensure they work seamlessly.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Virtualized File Tree üå≥
**Purpose**: Efficiently handle large projects with many files
**Testing**:
- [ ] Open a project with >100 files
- [ ] Verify smooth scrolling in file tree
- [ ] Test context menu (right-click on files/folders)
- [ ] Test drag & drop functionality
- [ ] Test create/rename/delete operations
- [ ] Verify only visible items are rendered (check performance)

### 2. Quick File Search üîç
**Purpose**: Keyboard-driven file navigation with fuzzy search
**Testing**:
- [ ] Press `Cmd+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) to open
- [ ] Type partial file names and verify fuzzy matching
- [ ] Use arrow keys to navigate results
- [ ] Press Enter to open selected file
- [ ] Press Escape to close modal
- [ ] Verify search works across nested directories

### 3. Incremental PDF Refresh üìÑ
**Purpose**: Preserve PDF view state during recompiles
**Testing**:
- [ ] Open a multi-page PDF
- [ ] Navigate to page 3, zoom to 150%, scroll to middle
- [ ] Make a text change and recompile
- [ ] Verify PDF updates but maintains page 3, zoom 150%, scroll position
- [ ] Test with different zoom levels and scroll positions

### 4. Keyboard Shortcuts ‚å®Ô∏è
**Purpose**: Fast access to common actions
**Testing**:
- [ ] `Cmd/Ctrl+B`: Trigger build
- [ ] `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+B`: Toggle auto-compile
- [ ] `Cmd/Ctrl+P`: Open quick file search
- [ ] `Escape`: Close modals/dialogs
- [ ] Verify shortcuts work from any focused element

### 5. Cold-Start Cache üíæ
**Purpose**: Remember recent projects and restore app state
**Testing**:
- [ ] Open several projects
- [ ] Close and restart application
- [ ] Verify recent projects list is populated
- [ ] Verify last opened project is suggested/auto-opened
- [ ] Test editor state persistence (cursor position, open files)

### 6. Incremental Builds ‚ö°
**Purpose**: Faster compilation by reusing unchanged outputs
**Testing**:
- [ ] Build a project (first build should be full)
- [ ] Make a small change and rebuild
- [ ] Verify second build is faster (incremental)
- [ ] Check that only changed files are recompiled
- [ ] Verify build output is correct

### 7. Clean Build Button üßπ
**Purpose**: Force full rebuild when needed
**Testing**:
- [ ] Find "Clean Build" button in topbar dropdown
- [ ] Click to trigger clean build
- [ ] Verify all cached files are cleared
- [ ] Verify full recompilation occurs
- [ ] Compare with regular incremental build

### 8. Auto-Compile Toggle üîÑ
**Purpose**: Control automatic compilation behavior
**Testing**:
- [ ] Toggle auto-compile ON in topbar
- [ ] Make file changes and verify automatic compilation
- [ ] Toggle auto-compile OFF
- [ ] Make file changes and verify NO automatic compilation
- [ ] Verify manual build still works when auto-compile is off

## Performance Expectations

### File Tree Performance
- Large projects (1000+ files) should render smoothly
- Scrolling should be 60fps with no lag
- Memory usage should remain reasonable

### PDF Viewer Performance
- Page navigation should be instant
- Zoom operations should be smooth
- Incremental updates should preserve user state

### Build Performance
- Initial builds: Baseline timing
- Incremental builds: 30-70% faster than full builds
- Clean builds: Same as initial builds

### Search Performance
- File search should return results instantly (<100ms)
- Fuzzy matching should be accurate and relevant
- Large project searches should remain fast

## User Experience Validation

### Workflow Tests
1. **Large Project Workflow**:
   - Open project with 500+ files
   - Use quick search to navigate
   - Make changes and verify incremental builds
   - Verify PDF state preservation

2. **Multi-File Editing**:
   - Open multiple files via quick search
   - Switch between files efficiently
   - Verify editor state is preserved

3. **Compilation Workflow**:
   - Test both auto-compile and manual modes
   - Verify clean builds when encountering issues
   - Check PDF viewer responsiveness

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test behavior with invalid LaTeX
- [ ] Test with missing files/dependencies
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation of features
- [ ] Test recovery from compilation errors

## Integration Verification

### IPC Communication
- [ ] All new IPC handlers respond correctly
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] No memory leaks in IPC channels

### State Management
- [ ] Settings persist correctly
- [ ] UI state updates properly
- [ ] No race conditions in state updates

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work on all platforms
- [ ] File operations work correctly
- [ ] Performance is consistent across platforms

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All features work without crashes or errors**
‚úÖ **Performance improvements are measurable**
‚úÖ **User experience is smooth and intuitive**
‚úÖ **Integration is seamless with existing features**
‚úÖ **No regressions in existing functionality**
